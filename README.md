# secureChat
This is a meteor.js project that would create encrypted chats rooms. The messages were encrypted client side, and any 
people who signed in with the same room ID would get a chat, using the room ID as the encryption key for symetric encryption. Based 
almost entirely on libraries by Emily Stark.
